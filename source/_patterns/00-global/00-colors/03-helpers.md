Color helper variables are meant to make it easier to swap out theme colors.

Use them instead of the theme-specific colors. Then if you want to change link color, text color, primary brand color, etc., you only have to change it in one place.

This list might not be up to date; consult `00_base/_colors.scss` for the current version.
